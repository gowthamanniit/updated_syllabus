- julia is a high level language like python with the performance of a fast language like c
- julia is a grat choice for scientific computing with
  *) Excellent performance
  *) N-dimensional arrays
  *) parallel and distributed computing
- And it is also nice environment for general programming with:
  *) An active ecosystem of packages and good tools for managing then
  *) a rich type system
  *) Iterators, asynchronous tasks, and coroutines.
